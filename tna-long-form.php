                        <p>It is difficult to overstate the impact of the First World War on global society. From the significant political consequences, to the military and medical legacies, the effects of the First World War on the development of society can still be seen today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legacy of the conflict is illustrated in the history of technology in the United Kingdom. Amongst the various technological developments to medical and military equipment is the significant impression the First World War had on telecommunications. Notably, the changes in telecommunications that became necessary due to the challenges of the period. The Engineering Department of the General Post Office, a government body that became British Telecom (or BT) in 1969, played a significant role in the First World War, and the history of this department in the First World War is a fascinating one that has survived in numerous documents and vivid images held by The National Archives, and at BT Archives themselves.

                        <p>
                            Logistics play an extraordinarily important part in the success or failure of soldiers in any battle. However, telecommunications is another aspect of life at war that is of incredible importance, often going unnoticed in historical representations of military activities in the First World War.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Engineering Department of the Post Office was a leading light for technical developments, with Post Office Engineers and commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers,  Major T.F. Purves overseeing the provision of over 200 items of special telecommunications apparatus all modified to fit the needs of British soldiers in the trenches. From modified cavalry field radios to gun spotter’s field communication devices the ability for troops and officers to receive and deliver information up and down the chain of command made for a better equipped army, able to make decisions and react quickly to events.

                            For example, in his report on the work of the Engineering Department of the Post Office during the First World War, Engineer-in-Chief Sir William Slingo included a letter from General Douglas Haig, Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France. The letter, dated 15th September 1916 and addressed to The Postmaster General, thanked the officers in the department for the great assistance provided in connection with ‘Sound Ranging’.

                            Sound Ranging is the name given to the application of physics via equipment - such as hot wire microphones - to determine the location of enemy artillery. Sound ranging can also be used to direct artillery guns at enemy coordinates. TNA houses a selection of documents that demonstrate the work being completed into sound ranging at this time. Photographs from the Ministry of Aviation picture apparatus used in conducting experiments into the crucial practice of sound ranging in order to develop this technology.

                            Furthermore, records belonging to the Geographical Section of the General Staff reveal some wonderful illustrative diagrams. The complexity of the diagram series possibly indicates the importance of developing more accurate and scientific Sound Ranging apparatus. That the Engineering Department of the Post Office were contributing to these experiments aptly indicates the crucial role the department was playing in the British war effort.

                            The First World War is often highlighted as the advent of mechanised warfare. Technological advances to weaponry required the development of apparatus such as that used for Sound Ranging in order to provide the men and women involved with as much chance of survival and success in the face of this new warfare. Of course, the First World War also saw the creation of the Royal Air Force, born of a merger of the British Army’s Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The birth of war in the air meant that telecommunications would have to evolve in order to keep intrepid pilots in the loop with intelligence gathering and decision making on the ground. Magnificent images taken from a 1918 handbook of airborne communication equipment indicate the way in which evolution of telecommunications in this period went hand in hand with military technology

                            The development of the throat microphone also proved a significant advancement as it, of course, allowed pilots to use their aircraft telephones without using their hands. Captain B.S. Cohen’s October 1919 report into Aircraft Telephones refers to some of the engineering work carried out to develop aircraft telephones such as the ‘hands free’ kit,

                            It is easy to see that both the geography of warfare and the need for quick-fire communication spurred on technological advancements that were adaptable on and off the battlefield.

                            The role of communications and the importance of having reliable telecommunications in the First World War was of total, fundamental importance. Of course, front line telecommunications were of great significance, as transferring information and orders up and down the chain of command, and to and from headquarters to the front line, could mean the difference between success and failure. One important and well used method of transferring intelligence and operational updates in warfare was the portable morse code machine, used by the British army throughout the conflict and often in trench holes.

                            The nature of telecommunications meant that it was not only on the Western Front but in other theatres that the importance of the Engineering Department’s work came into sharp focus. The use by the German government of Rigid Inflatable Airships or ‘Zeppelins’, so named after the German pioneer of the airship Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, was a cause for acute fear throughout mainland Britain during the First World War. Using these airships as bombers and scouts the German Army and Navy conducted many raids on mainland Britain - dropping bombs wherever possible to damage British infrastructure.

Upon the Engineering Department identifying the location of Enemy Aircraft this information would be wired to the Intelligence Department of the War Office immediately.  The signals were intercepted by the Engineering Department’s ‘Direction Finding Stations’ set up at Peterborough, Seaham Harbour, Westgate and, latterly, Falkirk in Scotland.

                            The role of the Engineering Department of the Post Office in keeping Britain as safe as possible during a time of national crisis cannot be overstated. This wonderful map from a Ministry of Munitions file indicates, in red, the areas of the country where communications would be suspended in times of an emergency, i.e. in the event the German army successfully landed in Great Britain. The wider document, which the map belongs to, states that in the event of invasion responsibility for communications in the country would be ceded from the Engineering Department to the Army Signal Service. Interestingly, under emergency protocols all communications would be suspended in Ireland if Britain was successfully invaded. In Great Britain itself, the map indicates that the East Coast of the country, from Dundee to the south coast would be without communications, in an attempt to hinder the progress of any invading army.

                            Perhaps one of the more stirring and action-packed roles of the Engineering Department were the administration and staffing of Cable Ships throughout the First World War. These ships were responsible for laying the cables required for trans-channel telecommunications to work. Such was the prominence of the cable ships of the Engineering Department, they even played a major part on the day war was declared. With war imminently due to be declared between the United Kingdom and Germany, according to Sir William Slingo’s report ‘the cables connecting England and Germany were disconnected on this side on the evening of the 4th and before War was declared, but on receipt of remonstrance from Germany, communication was temporarily restored’. The Engineering Department duly cut the cable again when war was announced officially just hours later.

                            The ship in this photograph is the ‘Monarch’ one of the Engineering Department’s cable ships from the First World War that was leased to the Grand Fleet of the Royal Navy and based at Scapa Flow. It struck a mine on 8th September 1915 whilst proceeding to repair the cable between Beachy Head and Havre sinking almost immediately and with the loss of three lives.

                            Within The National Archives there are several references to the bravery and danger undertaken by the staff of the General Post Office’s Engineering Department who staffed these cable ships.

                            These letters from the records of the Treasury highlight the responsibilities that were placed upon these men. In some cases, it became necessary for those of a relatively junior rank to essentially take on the role of ranks much higher than their own – e.g. Commander or Chief Officers for example. This was often undertaken for a reasonable period of time. Operations could be dangerous, with the risk of hostile action, meaning that these men had to be of a brave character. With such undertakings, it can be no surprise that it was deemed fair to provide these men with ‘substitution payments’ for their work.

                            With a great number of the Engineering Department’s workforce enlisting in the army, thousands of temporary workers were drafted in by the Post Office to replace them. Of great significance was the fact that many new recruits were female. Some employers refused to let married women work for them, so it tended to be single or widowed women who took up jobs outside of the home. However, within the Post Office, thousands of women, whether married or single, were employed. In such settings, these women were able to prove a variety of skills and aptitudes and the broad depth of capabilities. They now carried out a variety of tasks, including working a switchboard, instead of being confined to secretarial roles such as a typist.

                            This document from BT Archives interestingly states that it was a well-regarded opinion that the female ‘night telephonist’ was more adept at the job than her male counterpart. Once males and females worked alongside one another, this comparison was much more easily identifiable. Such a description acts to quash ideas that women were not capable of undertaking the same duties as men, because of certain characteristics that they were perceived to possess. For example, women were deemed “too emotional” for certain tasks (including having the right to vote) yet it is this sex who is described, in this example, as responding more appropriately when under extreme pressure.

                            Within Sir William Slingo’s report a fascinating and vivid graph exists appearing (at first glance)  to suggest that as the number of workmen in employment, below the rank of inspector, fell during the war, the number of female assistants rose above them. Looking closely at the graph axes indicates that this was not the case (male staff being measured in thousands and females in hundreds) but it interesting to note that the very existence of the graph implies that the female experience and contribution to work at the Engineering Department was worthy of note and comment at this time

                            As the above information suggests, and the array of vivid and interesting documentation and images confirm, the Engineering Department of the General Post Office (the historical antecedent of British Telecom) played a major role during the First World War supplying the British military services and the civilian populace of Great Britain with the crucial means of communication, whilst playing a significant part in technological innovation. The legacy of this work lives on in the holdings and archival material relating to the Engineering Department of the General Post Office, held at BT Archives in High Holborn, and also throughout the vast array of First World War material held at The National Archives in Kew.
