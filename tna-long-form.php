                    <p>It is difficult to overstate the impact of the First World War on global society. From the significant political consequences, to the military and medical legacies, the effects of the First World War on the development of society can still be seen today.

                        The legacy of the conflict is illustrated in the history of technology in the United Kingdom. Amongst the various technological developments to medical and military equipment is the significant impression the First World War had on telecommunications. Notably, the changes in telecommunications that became necessary due to the challenges of the period. The Engineering Department of the General Post Office, a government body that became British Telecom (or BT) in 1969, played a significant role in the First World War, and the history of this department in the First World War is a fascinating one that has survived in numerous documents and vivid images held by The National Archives, and at BT Archives themselves.

                        Logistics play an extraordinarily important part in the success or failure of soldiers in any battle. However, telecommunications is another aspect of life at war that is of incredible importance, often going unnoticed in historical representations of military activities in the First World War.

                        The Engineering Department of the Post Office was a leading light for technical developments, with Post Office Engineers and commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers,  Major T.F. Purves overseeing the provision of over 200 items of special telecommunications apparatus all modified to fit the needs of British soldiers in the trenches. From modified cavalry field radios to gun spotter’s field communication devices

                    <p>the ability for troops and officers to receive and deliver information up and down the chain of command made for a better equipped army, able to make decisions and react quickly to events.

                        For example, in his report on the work of the Engineering Department of the Post Office during the First World War, Engineer-in-Chief Sir William Slingo included a letter from General Douglas Haig, Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France. The letter, dated 15th September 1916 and addressed to The Postmaster General, thanked the officers in the department for the great assistance provided in connection with ‘Sound Ranging’.

                        Sound Ranging is the name given to the application of physics via equipment - such as hot wire microphones - to determine the location of enemy artillery. Sound ranging can also be used to direct artillery guns at enemy coordinates. TNA houses a selection of documents that demonstrate the work being completed into sound ranging at this time. Photographs from the Ministry of Aviation picture apparatus used in conducting experiments into the crucial practice of sound ranging in order to develop this technology

                        Furthermore, records belonging to the Geographical Section of the General Staff reveal some wonderful illustrative diagrams. The complexity of the diagram series possibly indicates the importance of developing more accurate and scientific Sound Ranging apparatus. That the Engineering Department of the Post Office were contributing to these experiments aptly indicates the crucial role the department was playing in the British war effort.

                        The First World War is often highlighted as the advent of mechanised warfare. Technological advances to weaponry required the development of apparatus such as that used for Sound Ranging in order to provide the men and women involved with as much chance of survival and success in the face of this new warfare. Of course, the First World War also saw the creation of the Royal Air Force, born of a merger of the British Army’s Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The birth of war in the air meant that telecommunications would have to evolve in order to keep intrepid pilots in the loop with intelligence gathering and decision making on the ground. Magnificent images taken from a 1918 handbook of airborne communication equipment indicate the way in which evolution of telecommunications in this period went hand in hand with military technology

                        The development of the throat microphone also proved a significant advancement as it, of course, allowed pilots to use their aircraft telephones without using their hands. Captain B.S. Cohen’s October 1919 report into Aircraft Telephones refers to some of the engineering work carried out to develop aircraft telephones such as the ‘hands free’ kit,

                        It is easy to see that both the geography of warfare and the need for quick-fire communication spurred on technological advancements that were adaptable on and off the battlefield.

                        The role of communications and the importance of having reliable telecommunications in the First World War was of total, fundamental importance. Of course, front line telecommunications were of great significance, as transferring information and orders up and down the chain of command, and to and from headquarters to the front line, could mean the difference between success and failure. One important and well used method of transferring intelligence and operational updates in warfare was the portable morse code machine, used by the British army throughout the conflict and often in trench holes.

                    <p>
                        The nature of telecommunications meant that it was not only on the Western Front but in other theatres that the importance of the Engineering Department’s work came into sharp focus. The use by the German government of Rigid Inflatable Airships or ‘Zeppelins’, so named after the German pioneer of the airship Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, was a cause for acute fear throughout mainland Britain during the First World War. Using these airships as bombers and scouts the German Army and Navy conducted many raids on mainland Britain - dropping bombs wherever possible to damage British infrastructure.
